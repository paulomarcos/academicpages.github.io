									you to cover your first month​</b> of rent, possible furniture, groceries, etc.</li>
									<li>If the first month of living expenses is not a problem, then proceed to send me an e-mail
									at paulo.marcos@zmp.co.jp (without spaces) with your CV and a cover letter (both in
									English)</li>
									<li>I will contact you back with a pre-pre-approval. If you are a good fit, you can then
									proceed to the next steps.</li>
									<li>The process after this will be in the form of Document Review -> Assignment or test ->
									1st skype technical interview -> 2nd skype interview with directors -> Offer from ZMP.</li>

										<h2>FAQ</h2>
											<h3>Can I really live in Japan without learning Japanese language?</h3>
											<p>Many people do, especially in Tokyo, where the office is located, so it is not impossible. However, the more Japanese you know,
											the easier it gets.</p>
											<h3>Why would I live in Tokyo?</h3>
											<p>If you are like me who really appreciates cleanliness, organization, safety and convenience,
											Tokyo is the place for you. Besides the amazingly cheap and delicious japanese food, extremely
											wide range of activities to do from bowling to tennis, from shopping for anime/manga goods to
											going to maid cafes, from the beautiful pink flower blossoms in Spring to the gorgeous red
											leaves in Autumn, Tokyo is the place to go.</p>
											<h3>How about the famous long overtime work system in Japan?</h3>
											<p>In our company we encourage people to work just the normal 8 hours a day. We have a flex
											time from 9am to 6pm of one hour, which means you can arrive between 8am and 10am and
											work 8 hours from there. If you come at 8am and leave by 5pm, no one will think less of you in
										  our company.</p>
