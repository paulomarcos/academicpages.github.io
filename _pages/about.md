Bio
-----
I am a second year graduate student at [Keio University](http://www.keio.ac.jp). I am currently studying about deep learning and computer vision under the supervision of [Professor Hideo Saito](http://hvrl.ics.keio.ac.jp/saito/). I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science by the Federal University of Parana (UFPR), in Brazil. My graduation thesis was "Development of Web Platform for Child Learning", a web system designed in Ruby on Rails to assist physically challenged children to learn reading and writing.

I have been granted two full scholarships to study abroad. The first one is a one-year study abroad program called [Science Without Borders](www.cienciasemfronteiras.gov.br/web/csf-eng), which I had the amazing experience of studying two terms at [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca) and one term for a co-op program working as a software developer at [CanAssist](https://canassist.ca), where I developed and implemented from the ground up an accessible [Single Switch Movie Player](http://www.canassist.ca/EN/main/programs/technologies-and-devices/hobbies-and-leisure/single-switch-movie-player.html) for individuals with severe cognitive and physical disabilities.
The second scholarship was granted by [Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology: MEXT](http://www.mext.go.jp/en/) of Japan. I am currently enrolled as a MEXT student at Keio University where I will finish my Masters program in March 2019.

On a side I micro vlog my experience in Japan for my family and friends and I teach English for Japanese customers at [Lancul](https://lancul.com), an English Conversation Cafe in Tokyo.

I am passionate about teaching, nature, deep learning and helping people in need through science. I speak native Portuguese, English and Japanese, and I have learned both foreign languages by myself, playing games, watching TV shows, listening to music and chatting with friends.
