It is growing bigger and stronger! Should we fear AI?
=====

I have heard many people discussing on whether we should fear AI dominating the world or not. In this article I will give my opinion on the topic and provide a few examples to support my statements.

When we say "Artificial Intelligence" and "Robots", immediately the image of an evil machine rises in our mind with super strength and a will to render human beings slaves for the whole eternity. It is a valid image, of course, specially with so many Hollywood movies pushing this fear into us to sell more movie theater tickets. However, let's not forget that AI is purely a tool like any other and it can and would be harmful if humans want it to be, but can also be harmless and helpful like any other technology.

Since AI is a technology like any other, let us go back to the beginning of civilization, when humans first learned how to manipulate fire. This ability pushed us far beyond any other animal on Earth, and separated us from other primates in the evolutionary scale. With fire we were able to warm ourselves in the winter, cook more delicious and healthier food, build stronger buildings, and so forth. Manipulating fire is a very special and distinct ability in the animal kingdom, and one would argue that fire is way more helpful than harmful. However, we absolutely can use fire for harm and in human history we can see it happening in many cases. But no one ever thought of banning fire from our lives. The technology of fire can be used for good and for bad purposes, like any other technology. It also applies for axes, knifes, cars, nuclear power, computers and so forth. AI is not different.

If you haven't seen the latest updates on the Google products and services shown at the Google I/O 2018 event, you should at least look at this [14 minutes summary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRUvbiWLwFI) published by the Verge on Youtube.

In this video they show how Deep Learning has helped with making AI an important tool in people's lives. AI can now help us booking services through actual phone calls using the newest Google Duplex which you can read more on the [Google AI Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html). It is amazing to see how AI has being rapidly becoming a must for companies which want to stay competitive. Cameras, maps, cars, you name it, almost every system or service can be improved with the help of AI. However, is it something we should fear?

The answer for this question is more complicated as it involves the willing of people. If we don't consider accidents, the AI is dangerous if, and only if, a person arbitrarily sets it to be harmful. Currently, it is impossible to create a robot to rule Earth on its own accord. Also, since a fully AI driven robot is a programmable machine, the machine will only intentionally harm a human if it is programmed to do so. So my personal answer to the question is: you should not fear AI, but instead you should fear people. Also, if a human does get harmed by a robot, the blame should always be towards the manufacturer of the robot, since no one blames a weapon for the murder, but the one responsible for firing the shot.

If you still fear AI after reading this article, consider starting learning a little bit more about AI with my previous post: [How to start your machine learning experience in 6 easy steps](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-start-your-machine-learning-experience-6-easy-steps-paulo-dores/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_pulse_read%3BAGvBA7h9TYKghWNBwmE5mg%3D%3D). It will help you understanding that AI can only do what is has been programmed to do. Nonetheless, AI is really important and will absolutely change the world around us like fire and electricity did.
